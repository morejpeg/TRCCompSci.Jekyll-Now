You can get a computer to portray a line of writing on the screen by using the simple commands "Console.WriteLine" and "Console.ReadLine".
For example,
Console.WriteLine("Hello world!") #this writes a line of string to the computer 
Console.ReadLine(); #This displays the writing on the screen for the user to see.
